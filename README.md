# Green Cities
Looking for the greenest cities in the USA

Cities are trying to be 'greener' and provide pleasant public spaces for residents. The inspiration for this project was an article and work done by the [Berliner Morgenpost](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/gruenste-staedte-deutschlands/) in 2016.

One question is '*what is the greenest city in the USA in 2018?*'. In addition to this question, I also would like to know if that state of green is growing, stable, or shrinking. This can be looked at as the change between 2 points in time, so I will also look at the greenness 5 years ago for compariason.

The cities under investigation will be those with a population over 100,000. Using those city boundaries the green value (NDVI) will be assessed, then we will see who is the greenest.
